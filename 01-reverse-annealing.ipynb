    "# The Reverse Anneal Feature\n",
    "\n",
    "The [What is Quantum Annealing?](https://docs.dwavequantum.com/en/latest/quantum_research/quantum_annealing_intro.html) page describes quantum annealing and the [QPU Solver Parameters](https://docs.dwavequantum.com/en/latest/quantum_research/solver_parameters.html) page describes the parameters used here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In brief, reverse annealing is a technique that makes it possible to refine known good local solutions, thereby increasing performance for certain applications. It comprises (1) annealing backward from a known classical state to a mid-anneal state of quantum superposition, (2) searching for optimum solutions at this mid-anneal point while in the presence of an increased transverse field (quantum state), and then (3) proceeding forward to a new classical state at the end of the anneal.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three parameters you can use to configure reverse annealing using Ocean:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `anneal_schedule` defines the annealing schedule that should be followed.\n",
    "2. `initial_state` specifies the classical state at which the reverse anneal should start.\n",
    "3. `reinitialize_state` specifies whether or not the initial state should be used for every anneal in the request.  If False, then after the first, each subsequent anneal starts where the previous finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reinitializing the Initial State\n",
    "\n",
    "The `reinitialize_state` parameter switches between two qualitatively different methods of local search via quantum annealing.  With `reinitialize_state = 'True'`, many anneals are seeded from the single starting state and the states returned, modulo time-dependent sources of error, are independently and identically distributed.  With `reinitialize_state = 'False'`, the series of anneals behaves like a random walk and is capable of exploring the solution space more broadly.  \n",
    "\n",

    "# Modulating the Reverse-Annealing Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Two straightforward ways to modulate the local search performed in reverse annealing are to change the start and duration of the pause in the annealing schedule. These are controlled by the `s_target` and `hold_time` arguments of the `make_reverse_anneal_schedule` function imported above.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Another parameter of the `make_reverse_anneal_schedule` function is `ramp_up_slope`, which in this notebook has been set to the maximum value allowed on the QPU. A less steep slope is more similar to following the pause with a forward anneal whereas a steep slope is similar to a \"quench\", which abruptly terminates the anneal. Quench resembles a projective readout when the dynamics of the system are slow relative to the timescale of the quench. Using the maximum slope when the local search of a paused schedule is in the right vicinity increases the probability of obtaining the ground state.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A lower value of `s_target` implies a larger transverse field, which leads to a broader search of the solution space.  A greater value of `hold_time` means that the reverse anneal is given more time to explore, which leads to a broader and deeper search of the solution space.  This subsection tries different combinations of these parameters and demonstrates the effect they have by plotting the distribution of energies and Hamming distance between consecutive reads."
